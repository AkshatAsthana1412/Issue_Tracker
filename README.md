# Issue_Tracker
This app allows users to track issues while development of a project, thus helping them to resolve their issues efficiently.
The developer can easily log any issues encountered during development and can track the status of the issue using this web app.

Technologies used:
  Language: Python, JavaScript
  Framework: Django, Bootstrap
  
The app involves a single Django Model: Issue to store details about the issues encountered and track their status.

There are 2 pages:
  The main 'issues' page: It displays the outstanding issues and their status (i.e. closed or open)
  The 'new-issue' page: It allows to log a new issue


Instructions to run:
Once you've cloned the source code, navigate to the source directory and run 'py manage.py runserver' on the command line.\n Open the browser and the local server will be running at the localhost ('127.0.0.1:8000')
